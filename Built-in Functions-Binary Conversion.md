# Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program to convert the number **16** into its **binary representation** using built-in Python functions.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Assign the value `16` to a variable `a`.
2. Use the built-in `bin()` function to convert the number to binary.
3. Print the result.

## 🧾 Program
```
a = 16
print(bin(a))
```

## Output
<img width="378" height="206" alt="530461355-c4269c2a-a929-40c4-9fb2-9a07a587466b" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/393c4da2-2a52-4737-b8be-71a9b9059c45" />

## Result
Thus a Python program to convert the number 16 into its binary representation using built-in Python functions is executed successfully.
